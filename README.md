# Revit Structural Modeling – Foundations

## Overview

This repository documents my structured study of **Section 1: Modeling and Materials** from a LinkedIn Learning course focused on structural modeling in Autodesk Revit.

Instead of passively consuming course material, this repo operationalizes the learning process through structured documentation aligned with the **Diátaxis framework**:

- **Tutorials** – Start-to-finish, guided learning by doing  
- **How-To Guides** – Task-oriented instructions  
- **Explanations** – Conceptual understanding  
- **Reference** – Neutral, lookup-style documentation  

The goal is to translate foundational Revit structural modeling concepts into clear, professional, reusable documentation.

---

## Scope

This repository covers:

**Section 1 – Modeling and Materials**

Topics include:

- Structural foundations  
- Structural floors  
- Structural walls  
- Structural columns  
- Structural framing  
- Stairs  
- Model and detail groups  
- Material assignment and modification  
- Material libraries  
- Selection sets  

Future sections (Families, Documentation, Views, Project Management) will be documented separately.

## Objectives

This repository serves three purposes:

1. Reinforce foundational Revit structural modeling concepts through documentation.
2. Develop technical writing aligned with professional engineering documentation standards.
3. Create a portfolio-ready artifact demonstrating structured learning and digital delivery awareness.

---

## Methodology

Each document type follows Diátaxis principles:

### Tutorials
Step-by-step guided exercises that build complete structural modeling workflows.

### How-To Guides
Direct, task-based instructions designed for real-world problem solving.

### Explanations
Conceptual discussions clarifying how Revit behaves and why modeling decisions matter.

### Reference
Neutral, concise lookup documentation for elements, tools, and system behaviors.
