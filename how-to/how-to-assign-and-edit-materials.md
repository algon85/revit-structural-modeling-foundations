# How-To: Assign and Edit Materials

This guide demonstrates the process of assigning materials to structural elements and modifying their graphic and physical properties.

## Overview
In Revit, materials are assigned either by **Category**, by **Element Type**, or by **Instance**. For structural modeling, the most common and "BIM-compliant" method is through **Type Properties**.

## Instructions
1. Select a structural element in your model (e.g., a Concrete Column or Steel Beam).
2. In the **Properties Palette**, click **Edit Type**.
3. Locate the **Materials and Finishes** section.
4. Click the small **[...] button** in the value field for "Structural Material." This opens the **Material Browser**.
