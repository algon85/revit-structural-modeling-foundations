# How-To: Assign and Edit Materials

This guide demonstrates the process of assigning materials to structural elements and modifying their graphic and physical properties.

## Overview
In Revit, materials are assigned either by **Category**, by **Element Type**, or by **Instance**. For structural modeling, the most common and "BIM-compliant" method is through **Type Properties**.

## Instructions

### 1. Accessing Material Properties
Instead of overwriting default materials, it is best practice to create a duplicate.
1. In the Material Browser, right-click an existing material (e.g., "Concrete, Cast-in-Place").
2. Select **Duplicate with Assets**.
3. Rename it (e.g., "ST-Concrete - 4000 PSI").
4. **Important:** Click the **Appearance** tab and click the "Duplicate this asset" icon (the number 2 icon) to ensure changes don't affect the original material.

### 2. Creating a New Material
Instead of overwriting default materials, it is best practice to create a duplicate.
1. In the Material Browser, right-click an existing material (e.g., "Concrete, Cast-in-Place").
2. Select **Duplicate with Assets**.
3. Rename it (e.g., "ST-Concrete - 4000 PSI").

### 3. Editing Material Graphics


### 4. Reviewing Physical Assets
