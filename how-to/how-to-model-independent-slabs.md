# How-To: Create an Independent Structural Slab (Driveway)

This guide demonstrates how to create a "self-hosted" structural slab. This method is used for elements like driveways, patios, or equipment pads that exist independently of vertical structural elements like walls or columns.

## Overview

Unlike foundations hosted by walls, a driveway is defined by its own boundary sketch and is hosted directly to a **Level** or a **Reference Plane**.
