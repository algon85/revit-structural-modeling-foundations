# How-To: Create an Independent Structural Slab (Driveway)

This guide demonstrates how to create a "self-hosted" structural slab. This method is used for elements like driveways, patios, or equipment pads that exist independently of vertical structural elements like walls or columns.

## Overview

Unlike foundations hosted by walls, a driveway is defined by its own boundary sketch and is hosted directly to a **Level** or a **Reference Plane**.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize the Slab Tool
1. Open the **Level 1** (or Grade) Floor Plan view.
2. Navigate to the **Structure** tab > **Foundation** panel.
3. Select **Slab (Structural Foundation: Slab)**.

### 2. Sketch the Boundary
Instead of using the "Pick Walls" tool, use the geometric draw tools to define a custom shape.
1. In the **Modify | Create Floor Boundary** tab, select the **Line** or **Rectangle** tool.
2. Sketch the perimeter of your driveway. 
3. **Tip:** Use the **Fillet Arc** tool if you need to create curved "flares" where the driveway meets the street.
4. Ensure the sketch forms a **closed loop** with no overlapping lines.
